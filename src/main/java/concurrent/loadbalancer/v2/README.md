1. 	Create a LoadBalancer class that has a method to register backend instances
      Each backend instance address should be unique, it should not be possible to register the same address two times
      Load balancer should accept up to 10 backend instances
      The code should be production ready
      The Loadbalancer will be released as a library

2. 	Develop an algorithm that, when invoking the Load Balancer's get() method multiple times,should return one backend-instance choosing
      between the registered ones randomly.
